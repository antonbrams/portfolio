				file: `2.mp4`,

				description: `Making a refrigerator magnet started entirely by hand. Operators glued a printed A3 sheet onto MDF, then cut back-, mid-, and foreground layers separately. Each layer had to be glued perfectly on top of the previous one so contours matched. Each magnet took several minutes, required skilled hands, and was expensive to scale.`,

			{
				file: `3.mp4`,
				title: `Print-and-cut alignment on CO₂ lasers`,
				description: `Cutting on large CO₂ lasers requires precise alignment with the glued print. Because the paper is glued manually, it can be slightly shifted, rotated, or scaled, and simple mechanical stops cannot correct this. Overhead cameras are too low-resolution to detect the print accurately. Standard print-and-cut in LightBurn software uses two small crosses printed on the sheet. Operators first navigate roughly to a cross using arrow keys, then adjust movement speed and carefully nudge the laser in sub-millimeter increments until the laser beam is centered on the cross. They mark this position in LightBurn, then repeat the process for the second cross, adjusting speed and position each time. This must be done with sub-millimeter precision dozens of times per shift.`,
			},
			{
				file: `4.mp4`,
				title: `Camera on the laser head - automatic alignment`,
				description: `I mounted an ESP32 camera directly on the laser head. The camera detects the printed cross markers regardless of rotation or scale. A feedback loop calculates the necessary laser head movement. During this phase, LightBurn is driven via simulated keyboard and mouse inputs to move the laser accordingly. This fully automates alignment, eliminating any manual adjustment.`,
			},
			{
				file: '6.mp4',
				title: `Switching from CO₂ lasers to a scalable diode laser farm`,
				description: `CO₂ lasers are large, expensive, require chillers, frequent mirror/lens cleaning, and extract smoke from the entire chamber, contaminating optics and mechanics. Scaling multiplies these issues. I switched to non-traditional, compact, relatively cheap 70 W diode lasers (minimum 1/4 the cost) and designed a modular rack with pull-out drawers for maintenance, shared air/exhaust channels, and centralized USB. Diode lasers provide G-Code support which allowed full control and automation through a custom system. A custom tray provides a fixed 0,0 reference for camera alignment, acts as a laser-safe floor, allows quick insertion and extraction of sheets, and seals against a suction funnel that extracts smoke directly at the cutting point. Fumes never reach optics or mechanics, enabling compact, low-maintenance, horizontally scalable operation.`,
			},

				title: `All-in-one system`,

			},
			{
				file: `7.mp4`,
				title: `Graphic and printing workflow`,
				description: `Previously, designers shared CorelDRAW files and PDF/SVG exports with machine operators via messenger, often losing track of versions. Separately, each product required manual file preparation: splitting the image into layers, applying ink-saving for covered regions, adding pixel bleed for cutting tolerance, and laying out A3 print and cut batches—all by hand. I replaced this with a fully automated pipeline: the designer uploads a minimal SVG containing a single picture and cutting outlines for the fore-, mid-, and background layers, and the system generates machine-ready PDFs and laser-ready SVGs per layer with ink-saving masks and bleed automatically. Once files are prepared, operators no longer face the tedious Windows printing process — manually selecting paper size, tray, color profile, and quantity. Instead, all settings are saved as presets, allowing printing with a single click.`,

				title: `Automatic print-and-cut execution`,
				description: `The operator selects a layer and triggers automatic alignment with a single click. Previously, cross registration required manual marking and keyboard/mouse simulation in LightBurn. Now, the custom software drives the laser via G-Code: it detects cross markers using camera feedback, computes the transformation matrix, and applies it to the SVG. Material presets automatically load cutting speed and power, and the cut starts fully automatically.`,

				title: `Smart-cut mode: Batch gluing via partial pre-cuts`,
				description: `Previously, each layer was cut and glued individually, requiring precise manual alignment. I redesigned the process: MDF sheets are first partially cut—only alignment holes and internal features—so the sheets remain whole and easy to handle, saving significant time. Multiple sheets are then stacked on alignment pins, glued as a single block, and returned to the laser for the final cut. Additional cutouts are included in the SVG to prevent glue from touching visible graphics. Small parts are only separated at the very end as a fully glued product. This ensures perfect alignment while drastically reducing manual labor.`,
			},
			{
				file: `12.mp4`,
				title: `Final contour cut with depth-aware logic`,
				description: `The final cut separates the finished products from the glued stack. Since the stack contains multiple layers, some areas need to be cut through all three layers, while others only through one or two. The SVG pipeline classifies contours by material depth using boolean operations and assigns different colors encoding laser power and speed. This ensures each area is cut with the appropriate intensity, maximizing efficiency and minimizing total processing time.`,

				title: `Problem`,
				description: `The current situation within the company shed light on the daunting obstacles faced by employees who are not well-versed in technology. They resorted to using WhatsApp to transmit photographs or handwritten pages, leading to a significant burden of communication. Valuable time was squandered as individuals struggled to decipher illegible handwriting, resulting in unnecessary phone calls to clarify information. Moreover, the CEO found themselves overwhelmed by the influx of data, comprising approximately 2000 diverse products and 100 clients.`,
			},
			{
				file: `15.png`,
				title: `Solution`,
				description: `To tackle these issues and alleviate the CEO's burden, I conceived the idea of introducing software solutions that streamline information processing and delegate data input to digital formats managed by bookkeepers, warehouse workers, and other stakeholders. For instance, within the warehouse, I meticulously crafted a dedicated and highly optimized page that empowers users to perform actions like marking products as "packed" with a mere single click. While designing such interfaces, I meticulously considered aspects like ergonomics, such as workers using iPads while walking or standing still, and whether they utilize hand gloves. By capturing and registering user input digitally, the need for handwritten notes or constant communication with the CEO became obsolete.

				Working in close collaboration with the employees, I adeptly designed and programmed customized full-stack solutions tailored to address their specific needs. My focus revolved around crafting nearly invisible yet immensely powerful features that would automate their analog processes. I continuously sought feedback from users through Zoom or in-person meetings, enabling me to refine the solutions and seamlessly implement them into production.
			
				As the sole technical expert on this project, I intentionally employed a minimal technological stack. While this might be suboptimal for industrial use, it proved to be highly advantageous in this context as it allowed me to swiftly roll out new features within hours! This rapid responsiveness to user requirements was pivotal in ensuring the success of the project. It remains an ongoing endeavor, constantly evolving alongside the company and its dedicated employees.`,

The system intelligently detects the edges of the products and automatically adjusts the selection, removing the need for precise aiming by the operator. By streamlining the image extraction process, this tool saves valuable time and effort.`,

				description:
					"Undoubtedly, the most challenging aspect of the Touchboard's development was creating the multitouch feature. To achieve this, I developed a custom C++ library for an advanced capacitive multitouch driver explained in a 500-page documentation 🤯. However, the touch-sensor-film had to be transparent to ensure that the display behind it remained visible, and we were unable to source the transparent film in the custom sizes we required. To overcome this hurdle, we innovated and manufactured our own ITO-coated plastic film at home, using lasers to substract conductive traces. The remaining traces were then interfaced to a flexible PCB using conductive ink. Despite the labor-intensive nature of this process, we persevered for three months and ultimately succeeded in delivering a Touchboard that provided an unparalleled user experience.",
