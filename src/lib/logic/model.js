			},
			{
				file: `14.png`,
				title: `Problem`,
				description: `The current situation within the company shed light on the daunting obstacles faced by employees who are not well-versed in technology. They resorted to using WhatsApp to transmit photographs or handwritten pages, leading to a significant burden of communication. Valuable time was squandered as individuals struggled to decipher illegible handwriting, resulting in unnecessary phone calls to clarify information. Moreover, the CEO found themselves overwhelmed by the influx of data, comprising approximately 2000 diverse products and 100 clients.`,
			},
			{
				file: `15.png`,
				title: `Solution`,
				description: `To tackle these issues and alleviate the CEO's burden, I conceived the idea of introducing software solutions that streamline information processing and delegate data input to digital formats managed by bookkeepers, warehouse workers, and other stakeholders. For instance, within the warehouse, I meticulously crafted a dedicated and highly optimized page that empowers users to perform actions like marking products as "packed" with a mere single click. While designing such interfaces, I meticulously considered aspects like ergonomics, such as workers using iPads while walking or standing still, and whether they utilize hand gloves. By capturing and registering user input digitally, the need for handwritten notes or constant communication with the CEO became obsolete.

				Working in close collaboration with the employees, I adeptly designed and programmed customized full-stack solutions tailored to address their specific needs. My focus revolved around crafting nearly invisible yet immensely powerful features that would automate their analog processes. I continuously sought feedback from users through Zoom or in-person meetings, enabling me to refine the solutions and seamlessly implement them into production.
			
				As the sole technical expert on this project, I intentionally employed a minimal technological stack. While this might be suboptimal for industrial use, it proved to be highly advantageous in this context as it allowed me to swiftly roll out new features within hours! This rapid responsiveness to user requirements was pivotal in ensuring the success of the project. It remains an ongoing endeavor, constantly evolving alongside the company and its dedicated employees.`,

				title: `Permissions`,

Fine-grained permissions for sections can be defined in the Settings section under the "Roles" card. This allows for customization of access rights based on different roles within the organization, ensuring that each worker has access to the relevant sections and functionalities.`,

The navigation follows a shallow structure, allowing users to switch sections easily through a simple menu. Within each section, users can view lists of items and access detailed information with the ability to go back easily. To edit content, dialog windows are utilized, providing a clear and intuitive interface. The overall UI design is focused on clarity and simplicity, ensuring an intuitive user experience.`,

This flexibility enables workers to efficiently use the software on their preferred devices, enhancing productivity throughout the organization.`,

These optimizations aim to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for mobile users.`,

I have also developed my own design system over the years, which helps streamline decision-making regarding colors, spacing, and responsiveness. This allows me to quickly roll out new features, often within hours. The modular design of the UI components ensures reusability and flexibility in development. Overall, the combination of Svelte, Tailwind, and my design system enables efficient and visually appealing UI development.`,

The tag system assigns properties to each item, such as city, category, size, and manufacturer. To find and edit items, employees can utilize the property filter, which enables them to generate complex search queries using a mouse. The filter allows for selection of multiple property values using the "OR" operator while combining properties with the "AND" operator. Additionally, right-clicking inverts the selection and excludes certain products. The property filter compiles user selections into a string query that is safely translated into an SQL query for efficient searching and editing.`,

Previously, they incurred significant expenses by ordering manually created Photoshop designs for plate prototypes.

By leveraging this tool, stakeholders can now design and iterate on their plate designs themselves, resulting in substantial cost and time savings for the company.`,

Employees can leverage the centralized database to efficiently add, edit, and manage products, people, and shipping details through the "Settings" section. Moving forward, the plan is to create simplified views specifically tailored for employees working in the warehouse. These views will streamline the process of order fulfillment, providing warehouse employees with a user-friendly interface to efficiently handle order processing and shipping tasks.`,

With this tool, operators can effortlessly extract images using simple mouse selections, eliminating the requirement for Photoshop or complex editing software. The system intelligently detects the edges of the products and automatically adjusts the selection, removing the need for precise aiming by the operator. By streamlining the image extraction process, this tool saves valuable time and effort.`,

					"Undoubtedly, the most challenging aspect of the Touchboard's development was creating the multitouch feature. To achieve this, I developed a custom C++ library for an advanced capacitive multitouch driver explained in a 500-page documentation 🤯. However, the touch-sensor-film had to be transparent to ensure that the display behind it remained visible, and we were unable to source the transparent film in the custom sizes we required. To overcome this hurdle, we innovated and manufactured our own ITO-coated plastic film at home, using lasers to substract conductive traces. The remaining traces were then interfaced to a flexible PCB using conductive ink. Despite the labor-intensive nature of this process, we persevered for three months and ultimately succeeded in delivering a Touchboard that provided an unparalleled user experience.",
